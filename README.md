# GSIbec
GSIbec: Extracts the background error covariance (BEC) model capabilities from 
 the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) atmospheric analysis system into a 
 library of its own.

The main objective of this library is to aid JEDI and make the GSI BEC available
for applications of interest in that context.

Strong dependencies: MPI
Weak dependecies: SP (spectral lib from NCEP)

This package should be renamed lower-case gsibec after cloning.
