look for USE_ALL_ORIGINAL

- will need to call: init_general_commvars_dims
- remove regional from gridmod
- remove hyb from bkgcov; interface change
- remove lsqrtb, tlnmc, and regional from balmod (balmod to F90)
- remove hybens from control_vector
- interface change in random_cv
- interface change to read_wgt
- ifdef'ed out aircraft predictors from berror (from f90 to F90)
- bkerror: f90 to F90; remove lsqrtb check; ifdef hyb out; interface change
- bkgvar: interface change; from f90 to F90
- smoothrf.f90 to smoothrf.F90

TODO:

general_commvars - make dvars optional

rid code of bacio lib dependence, ie. replace these:
baopenwt
wryte
baclose

tsensible: is non-sense define CV var name for T should be enough to determine T var
balmod: decision on when to apply balance operator is too restrictive (should not need all t,ps,sf,vp)

sequence:

bkerror
tbalmod
bkgcov
  bkgvar
  frfhvo
  sub2grid
  smoothrf
  grid2sub
  frfhvo
  bkgvar
balmod


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
   TO DO FOR SABER CONNECTION
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- replace kinds w/ OOPS kinds
- interface to return lats/lons
- correctly pass guess information, that is:
  o set pressures as those from JEDI seen guess_grids: guess_grids_get_ref_gesprs
  o properly fill in required guess fields; see guess_grids guess_basics


Other TO DOs
------------
- revise items above
- fill in halo for var comming from saber
- var units fixes must be moved to center-specific dir
- eta levels should come from JEDI
